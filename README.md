# About
[CoronaTracker.com](https://www.coronatracker.com/) acts as a portal for the public to keep track of the latest news development about the COVID-19, alongside collecting data for further analysis. 

All the contents are handpicked, filtered, and curated by volunteers to our best extent to ensure that sources are reliable with minimal hoaxes and fake news, for the best benefit of the public. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to analyze trending content and identify meaningful topics over various news sources and social media platforms prior to being verified by our team.

# Analytic Team
A team of data scientists uses OSEMN framework to collect, clean, explore, model, and run the analysis. For ease of public understanding, it is presented using graphic visualizations and dashboards. 

My main task is to maintain the web-scraping tool in efforts to keep the database updated accurately using MySQL Workbench. In the meantime, I also create report and generate insights using data extracted from the database.
